# Shumpei Urabe (yaminoma)

Hi, I'm Shumpei Urabe — a technology leader and multimedia specialist with expertise in video coding, acoustic signal processing, and large-scale system architecture.
I work across industries as a CTO, technical advisor, and engineer, helping companies build high-performance streaming, broadcasting, and AI-driven platforms.

I enjoy tackling complex challenges — from optimizing multithreaded processing and memory management to scaling distributed systems — and delivering solutions that push boundaries.
My past work includes leading infrastructure and product development for live streaming platforms, voice processing systems, and enterprise-grade content distribution.

Outside of work, I love experimenting with ideas that no one has tried before, blending creativity with engineering to bring them to life.
