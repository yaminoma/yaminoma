Hi, I'm Shumpei Urabe. I'm a multimedia specialist, specializing in video coding and acoustic signal processing.
I have no programming language preference, but I'm interested in multithreaded processing and memory management.
I usually work for a Japanese broadcasting company developing distribution systems.
I like to challenge myself to do things that no one has tried before!
